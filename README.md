# Q Editor

This is the editor for the Q Toolbox. To make use of Q editor you will also need a [Q server](https://nzzdev.github.io/Q-server/).
Here you find some technical documentation to get your own Q editor running.

Q editor needs a modern browser with support for Shadow DOM, quite some ES2015 features and CSS Grid Layout. It works only in Chromium based browsers and Safari >= 10.1 (with some minor visual problems) at the moment.

Demo: https://q-demo.st.nzz.ch

## Setup
### Deployment
We provide automatically built docker images for Q editor at https://hub.docker.com/r/nzzonline/q-editor/.
You have three options for deployment:
- use the provided images
- build your own docker images
- deploy the service using another technology

#### Use the provided docker images
1. Deploy `nzzonline/q-editor` to a docker environment
2. You can set the following ENV variables
    - `PORT`: defaults to `8080`, the port Q editor will be listening on
    - `Q_SERVER_BASE_URL`: required, the url to a running [Q server](https://nzzdev.github.io/Q-server/)
    - `LOGIN_MESSAGE`: defaults to `null`, a string that is displayed on the login screen
    - `DEV_LOGGING`: defaults to `false`, if `true` lots of console log messages will appear
    - `PUSH_STATE`: defaults to `true`, if `true` the editor will use nice urls without `#` but needs server support (so it's only used for production, for development `#` is used)
    - `MAPZEN_API_KEY`: defaults to `null`, only needed if the geocoding is used in one of your tools. Get one at https://mapzen.com

#### Build your own docker images / deploy using another technology
If you choose to build your own docker image or deploy it some other way make sure that you run `cd client && npm install && jspm install && gulp export` to build the client.

### Configuration
Apart from the ENV variables mentioned above, Q editor gets its configuration from the Q server. You need a running [Q server](https://nzzdev.github.io/Q-server/) now so head over to https://nzzdev.github.io/Q-server/install.html if you haven't already. This is what you can configure in `config/editorConfig.js` of your Q server implementation:

```js
const editorConfig = {
  languages: [ // an array of languages, if more that one is configured, Q editor will show a language switcher
    {
      key: 'de',
      label: 'de'
    },
    {
      key: 'en',
      label: 'en'
    }
  ],
  departments: [ // every item is assign one department. These are used for the filtering on the overview.
    "International",
    "Economics",
    "Sport"
  ],
  lowNewItems: {   // if there are not enough graphics, M will appear instead of Q. This is used to configure 'not enough'.
    threshold: 21, // less than that many new items..
    days: 7        // in the last days are considered 'not enough'
  },
  itemList: {
    itemsPerLoad: 18 // how many items to load per step (load more) on item overview
  },
  schemaEditor: {
    latLngLayerConfig: { // if you use schema-editor-lat-lng this is the layer config for Leaflet
      url: 'https://stamen-tiles.a.ssl.fastly.net/terrain/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
      config: {
        attribution: 'Map tiles by <a href="http://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>, under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC BY 3.0</a>. Data by <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, under <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">ODbL</a>.'
      }
    }
  },
  help: { // configuration for the help dialog. this has no localization support for now :-(
    intro: 'some text that can contain html', // shown on top of the dialog
    faq: [ // a list of questions and answers shown below the intro
      {
        question: 'What is this?',
        answer: 'This is a Storytelling Toolbox'
      },
      {
        question: 'Why?',
        answer: 'Because there is more than letters.'
      }
    ]
  },
  stylesheets: [ // a list of stylesheets to load in addition to the default styles. Use this to load your theme if you do not like our design
    {
      url: ''
    },
  ],
  metaInformation: {
    // if articlesWithItem is given Q-editor makes a GET request to the endpoint on Q-server (if path, you can provide url instead) and expects a json array like this
    // [
    //  {
    //    title: '', // this string will be the text of the link to the url
    //    url: '', // url to the article
    //    publicationDate: '', // something Date.parse() understands
    //    publicationLastUpdated: '' // something Date.parse() understands
    //  }
    // ]
    articlesWithItem: {
      endpoint: {
        path: 'meta/articles-with-item/{id}'
      }
    }
  },
  uiBehavior: {
    useItemDialogToActivate: true // if false, item is directly activatable from tool-status-bar (default: true)
    askBeforeEditIfActive: { // if given the editor will ask users before editing an active item that was last editor longer than lastEditSecondsThreshold before
      lastEditSecondsThreshold: 60 * 60 * 6 // 6 hours
    }
  },
  eastereggs: { // there are some eastereggs in Q. provide the urls to the soundfiles here. We do not distribute them because we do not have the copyright for the tunes we use at NZZ.
    sounds: {
      m: '', // played if M is visible and user hovers her
      q: '', // played/paused if user types Shift+Q
      bondTheme: '' // played if user types Shift+0 Shift+0 Shift+7
    }
  }
```

Q Editor uses the tools configuration from the Q Server to search for items of the configured tools in the database and check their availability using availabilityChecks to e.g. make a tool available only for specific roles like configured below. This is what you can configure in the `editor` property of any tool configured in `config.tools` of your Q Server config:
```js
  {
    label_locales: {
      de: 'Label de',
      en: 'Label en',
    },
    availabilityChecks: [
      {
        type: 'UserHasRole',
        role: 'any-role-the-user-needs'
      }
    ],
    icon: 'svg string used as the tool icon'
  }
```

## Development

Q editor consists of two parts:
- the server part
- the client part

The server part is a small webserver built on [hapijs](https://hapijs.com/) that serves the client files and the ENV variables at `/env` endpoint.
The client part is a web application built on [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io). This is were most of the work is done.

Q editor communicates with the endpoints provided by a Q server directly.

For development you can run the client part without the server part:
You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and `npm`.
When you have this installed running the following commands in the root of this project should give you a working environment.

```
npm install -g jspm
cd client
npm install
jspm install
```

After that you can start a live reloading webserver by running `gulp watch` within the folder `client`.

### env
See the file `client/env`. This is loaded for development only and "fakes" the environment served by the Q server part on production:
```
{
  "QServerBaseUrl": "http://localhost:3001",
  "loginMessage": "some text to be shown on the login screen",
  "devLogging": true,
  "pushState": false
}
```
where `QServerBaseUrl` is a url to a running [Q server](https://github.com/nzzdev/Q-server).
Start one locally or use your staging environment. You probably do not want to develop using your production Q server.
